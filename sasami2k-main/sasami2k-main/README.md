# SASAMI2k 757 — portable build

A no-installer, self-contained copy of **SASAMI2k Core build #757** (2001‑08‑24),
the DirectShow/ActiveMovie2 media player by Ui‑jong Choi (`nuclei@shinbiro.com`,
"Project SASAMI2k", supported by Kiwidream). Files were extracted from the
original Windows installer `sasami2k_757.exe` and are byte‑identical to what it
would have installed.

> SASAMI = *Specially Advanced Synchronized Accessible Media Interchange*
> Release note from the author: *"Release ; 2001/08/24 Core #757, SMI Converter #309, Main filter 1921"*

---

## Quick start

1. Double‑click **`SASAMI2k.cmd`**.
2. On first run it registers the three DirectShow filters for the current user
   (no admin prompt), then starts the player.
3. Open a file, or drop one on the launcher: `SASAMI2k.cmd "D:\movie.avi"`.

If video does not play, register the filters machine‑wide once — right‑click
**`RegisterFilters.cmd`** → *Run as administrator*. Check the current state at any
time with **`Status.cmd`**.

Moving or renaming the folder is fine: the launcher notices the filters point at
the old path and re‑registers them.

  sasami2k_757.exe            The original installer, kept for provenance
  sasami2000.packed.exe       The player exactly as shipped (UPX-packed, unpatched)
```

Two small compatibility fixes were necessary to make a 2001 DirectShow app start
on Windows 10/11: the skin bitmaps had to be re-encoded from RLE8, and one
`auxGetNumDevs` import thunk is neutralised. Both are documented byte-for-byte,
with symptoms, evidence and reproduction steps, in **[PATCHES.md](PATCHES.md)**;
`original/` keeps the untouched binaries.

Everything else is still byte-identical to the installer payload
(`Sasami2000_Translator.exe` and the three `.ax` filters are unmodified).

---

## Rebuilding from the installer

Everything under `app\` is derived and can be regenerated from the pristine
installer in one step:

```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\build.ps1
```

The script verifies the installer's SHA-256, extracts the CRC-checked payload,
UPX-unpacks the player, applies the import-thunk patch, re-encodes the seven skin
bitmaps, derives the `*.default.ini` files, copies the launcher, and then checks
every produced file against `HASHES.txt`. A clean run ends with:

```
==> Verifying against HASHES.txt
    all 39 manifest entries reproduce exactly
```

Requirements: Windows PowerShell 5.1 and Python 3 on `PATH`. UPX is vendored in
`tools\upx\` (GPL, see `tools\upx\README-SASAMI2k.txt`); pass `-Upx <path>` to
use a different build. Output defaults to `build\portable` (`-OutDir`), and
`-KeepWork` keeps the temporary extraction for inspection.

`original\` (the pristine installer) and `tools\upx\` (rebuild-only tooling) are
inputs, so they are deliberately not copied into the output and are excluded from
the output verification. The built tree is self-contained: running its
`SASAMI2k.cmd` re-points the filter registration at itself.

---

## Single-file build

`tools\make-singlefile.ps1` packs the whole portable tree into one executable:

```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\make-singlefile.ps1
-> build\SASAMI2k-portable.exe   (~783 KB incl. a ~774 KB payload)
```

The executable is a small .NET bootstrapper with a ZIP payload appended behind a
24-byte footer (`S2KSFX01`, offset, length). On first run it unpacks the tree next
to itself into `SASAMI2k.data\` - or into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SASAMI2k.data\` when
that folder is not writable - records a stamp so later runs skip extraction, and
then invokes the normal `tools\portable.ps1 launch` with whatever arguments it was
given. Settings persist in `SASAMI2k.data\app\SASAMI2k.ini`, and a short
`SASAMI2k.data\launch.log` records each launcher invocation.

```
SASAMI2k-portable.exe "D:\movie.avi"
SASAMI2k-portable.exe /fullscreen "D:\movie.avi"
```

The build self-tests: it extracts the payload to a temporary folder and compares
every file against the source tree before reporting success (41/41 byte-identical).

Requirements: `csc.exe` from .NET Framework 4.x (present on Windows 10/11) and
PowerShell 5.1. The payload ZIP is written with fixed entry timestamps, so building
the same tree twice produces the same executable.

---

## Why a launcher is needed

SASAMI2k builds its filter graph through COM, so the three `.ax` modules must be
registered before the player can create them. The original installer did this
silently with `Sasami2000.exe /register`, which in turn runs
`regsvr32.exe /s <path>\<name>.ax`, using the 32-bit build from
`%SystemRoot%\SysWOW64`.

Being a DirectShow app, it cannot be *completely* registry‑free — but the
registration is small, points at this folder, and is easy to undo:

| Module | CLSID | Registered as |
|---|---|---|
| `Sasami.ax` | `{6FFBDFFE-C9CE-11D3-BBAA-52544C191AD1}` | `HKCR\CLSID\…\InprocServer32`, `ThreadingModel=Both` |
| `Sasami4a.ax` | `{6FFBDFFE-C9CE-11DB-BBAA-52544C191AD1}` | same |
| `Sasamiv4a.ax` | `{FD501041-8EBE-11DE-8183-00AA00577DA1}` | same |

`RegisterFilters.cmd` runs the system's **32‑bit** `regsvr32.exe` from
`%SystemRoot%\SysWOW64`: on 64‑bit Windows the `regsvr32` in `System32` is the
64‑bit build and cannot register a 32‑bit DirectShow filter. The 1999 copy the
installer shipped is kept only as a fallback for hosts without `SysWOW64`.

For the same reason the per‑user fallback writes to the **WOW64 view**,
`HKCU\Software\Classes\Wow6432Node\CLSID\…`. An entry in the plain
`HKCU\Software\Classes\CLSID` is visible only to 64‑bit clients: the 32‑bit
player then fails `CoCreateInstance` with `REGDB_E_CLASSNOTREG`, builds no filter
graph and quietly never plays anything.

---

## What this touches on your system

* **Registry (filters)** — the three `CLSID` keys above, either machine‑wide
  (`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Classes\WOW6432Node\CLSID\…`) or per‑user
  (`HKCU\Software\Classes\Wow6432Node\CLSID\…`). The **WOW64 view is
  required**: these are 32‑bit filters, and an entry in the plain
  `CLSID` key is invisible to the 32‑bit player. `UnregisterFilters.cmd` removes them.
* **Registry (file types)** — nothing is changed by a normal launch. The binary
  does contain association‑repair code and strings (`.mms`, `.asx`, `.smi`, `.s2k`
  ProgIDs with `Open`/`Read`/`Play`/`Enqueue` verbs), and the built‑in help
  documents `/unregister` as *"unregister sasami filters, and repair associated
  files"*. On this build, however, neither a normal start nor `sasami2k.exe
  /register` created or modified any file association — checked by comparing
  `HKCU`/`HKLM` classes entries before and after.
* **Files** — everything else stays inside this folder. The player writes its
  preferences to `app\SASAMI2k.ini` (and the translator to
  `app\SASAMI2k_Translator.ini`); those live files are created from the shipped
  `*.default.ini` on first run and are deliberately not tracked, so your settings
  travel with the folder without dirtying the repository. Delete them to reset.

No installer, no service, no background updater, no network access of its own
(the original installer contains no networking code at all; the only URLs in the
player are the author's homepage and e‑mail address).

## Player command line

From the built‑in help:

```
[ SASAMI2k, command line options ]
/first       : show greeting message.
/register    : register sasami filters.
/unregister  : unregister sasami filters, and repair associated files.
[file] /add  : enqueue [file] in playlist.
/help        : show this message.
/fullscreen  : start with fullscreen mode.
/maxscreen   : start with maxscreen mode.
```

Pass them through the launcher, e.g. `SASAMI2k.cmd /maxscreen "D:\movie.avi"`.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Nothing happens / launcher exits with code 1** — run `Status.cmd`; it prints the
folder, whether the player is present, and the registration state.

**A file is accepted but nothing plays** — the filter registration is not visible
to the 32‑bit player. `Status.cmd` shows this as *"only in the 64‑bit view; the
32‑bit player cannot see it"*; run `SASAMI2k.cmd` again (it repairs this) or
`RegisterFilters.cmd` as administrator.

**"Failed to Register …" or video stays black** — the per‑user registration may
not be visible to the DirectShow filter mapper on your system. Run
`RegisterFilters.cmd` as administrator once.

**Moved the folder and playback broke** — run `SASAMI2k.cmd` again; it detects the
stale path and re‑registers. `Status.cmd` will show `-> points elsewhere: …`.

**No subtitles / wrong language** — subtitles are `.smi` / `.s2k`; the UI language
is `Sasami.Preference.LanguageFile` in `app\SASAMI2k.ini` (a file in
`app\Languages\`).

**"Select files to play" appears at startup** — that is the player's normal
open dialog when it is started without a file. Pass a file to skip it.

**Security software complains** — the 2001 binaries are unsigned and the
translator is still UPX-packed, which trips generic heuristics. The player itself
is shipped unpacked (see [PATCHES.md](PATCHES.md)); every file's SHA-256 is in
`HASHES.txt`.

---

## Known limitations

* **44.1 kHz MPEG audio crackles.** Clips whose audio is MPEG-1 Layer II at
  44.1 kHz - typical of the old `.mpg` AMV rips - play with crackling/buzzing.
  The same video with 48 kHz MPEG audio, or with uncompressed PCM audio, plays
  cleanly, so the fault is in the decoder DirectShow picks: the built-in
  `quartz.dll` "MPEG Audio Codec" (`{4A2286E0-7BEF-11CE-9BD9-0000E202599C}`), the
  only MPEG audio decoder the filter graph builder will select on this system.
  * Swapping it is not possible with registry values alone: LAV Filters (installed
    via K-Lite) is registered only as a COM server, with no DirectShow
    filter-mapper entry, so the graph builder never considers it; and Microsoft's
    decoder key is owned by `TrustedInstaller` with Administrators read-only, so
    its merit cannot be lowered either.
  * Workarounds: let K-Lite's Codec Tweak Tool register LAV properly, or remux
    the audio to 48 kHz.

## Provenance and verification

The portable tree is a direct extraction of the installer's InstallFactory
archive (`IFFH` records: name, unpacked size, packed size, CRC32, DOS timestamp,
raw deflate). All 31 records were inflated and **every CRC32 and size matched**.
The installed payload totals 1,011,640 bytes, exactly the `SpaceNeeded=1011640`
declared by the installer's own configuration.

* Original installer SHA-256: `4e2b22e4c280d19f804bbc3594f8b9c308179f8481f8b61f84e7bd1aeb88ee21`
* Installer payload: 25 files, 7 skin bitmaps, 7 localisations.

Intentional changes to the shipped data, all documented:

* `app\SASAMI2k.default.ini` — `Sasami.LastDirectory` reset (the original pointed
  at a folder on the author's machine); the live `.ini` is generated from this file.
* `app\sasami2k.exe` — unpacked, one import thunk patched, and renamed from
  `sasami2000.exe` to escape a broken Windows compatibility shim (PATCHES.md, fixes 2 and 3).
* `app\Imgs\*.bmp` — seven RLE8 bitmaps re-encoded as BI_RGB (PATCHES.md, fix 1).

`tools/extract_installer.py` and `tools/compat_fixes.py` reproduce both the
pristine payload and the fixed binaries; the shipped artefacts were verified to be
reproduced byte-for-byte.
